# Lunarbits Historic Lunar Space Background

Lunarbits were launched inbedded with QR codes inscribed on nickel disks inside a timecapsule (Lunaprise IM-1 Mision). The time capsule, which contained bitcoin projects including the first bitcoin whitepaper to land on the moon,  was bolted to the Odessyus Lunar Lander. On February 15th, 2025 the payload was launched to the moon atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 in a private sector mission landing on the south pole of the moon on 2.22, February 22nd, 2024. The time capsule project was curated by Space Blue, a private space and content company ( along with Galatic Legacy Labs, the payload partner) and a community quickly evolved supporting the launch of the first bitcoin memecoin born on the moon. The Lunarbits project is community driven and not authored or curated by SpaceX or NASA, and is part of the first private commercial space mission to land on the moon in 50 years for NASA ,The USA and private funded projects like Space Blue's initiatives to land art, commercial content and bitcoin projects on the moon.


Space Blue, as the only authorized party for certifications of assets in the timecapsule,  maintains a registry of official payloads of content it curated and stored in the time capsule and their metadata which landed on the moon at:
https://verify.spaceblue.club/ 
Further information on the space mission itself can be found online at https://github.com/lunaprise and https://spaceblue.club


Lunarbits verification can be obtained there of its payload inscribed and sent to the moon by entering the name Lunarbits in the verification query and/or payload ID of 244. 

Lunarbits now also on earth have been memorialized  and inscribed as Bitcoin Tokens using a protocol developed by the bitcoin ordinals community in 2024 called Bitcoin Runes and were inscribed  as Lunarbits on August 2nd, 2024. The Bitcoin Runes Protocol is not created or authored by Lunarbits and thus Lunarbits are inscribed on a third party trusted Bitcoin inscription platform called Luminex which as of this date Luminex.io has launched tens of thousands of inscription projects on its platform.

Locked Up Tokens i.e, Mininum 197.77 million Lunarbits are to Be transferred to an escrowed third party qualified financial institution (such as Coinbase, or Gemini or other) cold wallet storage upon the Lunarnits public listing, as per Lunarbits DAO Foundation Advisory Guidelines and released per the release schedule each year as determined by DAO which may also determine to burn certain reserved Lunarbits tokens. 

## BITCOIN BLOCKCHAIN SECURITY

As a Bitcoin Runes token, Lunarbits leverages Bitcoin’s L1 security, the most robust in crypto, reducing risks of hacks or double-spending. Its UTXO-based model integrates seamlessly with Bitcoin’s architecture, unlike the less efficient BRC-20 standard.


### Burning Provision for Lunarbits Treasury Reserve:
To enhance the Lunarbits tokenomics and create deflationary pressure that could potentially increase token value over time, implementing effective token-burning strategies is a strong approach. Token burning involves permanently removing tokens from circulation, reducing the total supply and signaling scarcity to investors. A burn proposal is being considered by the Lunarbits advisory team and such proposals and new proposals will likely be a part of the DAO voting process. Learn more about the first such burn proposal at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bJxL_VNfzsQH440dlbZHcDXWfCRSfGpsmiCnSeug_ug/edit?usp=sharing


Lunarbits was pre mined aa a closed mint on the Luninex platform, a third party widely used and trusted in the bitcoin ordinals and bitcoin runes community. Learn more at https://luminex.io/

Additional methods to proof the mint:

Auditing a Bitcoin Runes project inscribed on Luminex.io, when Luminex when minting is not controlled by the project team, is feasible by leveraging Bitcoin’s blockchain transparency and alternative tools. Key steps include verifying the etching transaction, tracing minting activity, auditing Runestone security, assessing the team and third-party minting, and checking market health. Tools like ordiscan.com, Mempool.space, GeniiData, RuneScan, and Runes Indexer replace Luminex’s dashboard, while security firms ensure thorough analysis. For third-party minting, cross-reference logs with on-chain data and audit their security. To reduce risks, use multi-sig wallets, pre-audit Runestones, monitor transactions, and rely on decentralized indexers. This approach ensures a robust audit, even in challenging conditions, protecting investors and users.

## The Bitcoin Runes Protocol

Introduction to Runes:

The Bitcoin Runes Protocol is not created or authored by Lunarbits. Lunarbits were inscribed on a third party trusted Bitcoin Runes inscription platform called Luminex. Lunarbits is not its own protocol but rather is a token project inscribed on the Bitcoin network using the inscription tool launched by Luminex. 

Runes is a fungible token protocol for the Bitcoin network that aims to be simple and UTXO-based. Rune balances are held by UTXOs, and transactions are identified using specific script conditions. Luminex launched in April, 2024 a set of Rune tools, allowing the Lunarbits team to  etch, mint and transfer its Lunarbits Bitcoin Runes Tokens to its initial treasury wallet. 


Interested parties can discover Lunarbits mint verification verified on many bitcoin runes explorers and decentralized wallets such as Xverse,  Unisat, MagicEden, OKX,   and including on Luminex where parties can inspect: 

1. Lunarbits initial closed mint. was on the final closed mint on August 02, 2024 lunarbits adnistratrators transferred all 222.222 million Lunarbits tokens to the initial treasury wallet.

2. Luminex Explorer
Allows the public to see overview of many Runes projects,and Runes and Ordinals addresses. With summaries as to holdings, estimated market cap net worth, and balances by wallet holders.

3. Luminex Audit and Documentation. Lminex if it conducted audits of its software systen used to mint Lunarbits and other Runes projects then such audits may be available on their website and github.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
1. What is Rune?
RUNE is a UTXO-based fungible token protocol for the Bitcoin network. It allows for the issuance and management of tokens within the Bitcoin ecosystem.

2. What's the difference between Open Mint, Premine and Closed Mint?

Open Mint: A rune that is available to mint from any address through an on-chain Rune transaction and allocate a fixed amount of new units for themselves. There is no mint price going to whoever deployed the Rune. An open mint is subject to the Mint Terms.

Premine: The deployer of the Rune can decide to allocate to themselves an amount of Runes within the Etching transaction. This allocation is called Premine.

Closed Mint: A rune can be fully pre-mined within the Etching transaction. The total supply will be equal to the premine allocation of the etcher.

Lunarbirs is a closed mint premined. evidence of that can be seen in the inscription proof.

3. What are the Mint Terms? These are the rules that determine when an open mint opens or closes. For example, a mint may be limited to a starting height, an ending height, and a cap, and will be open between the starting height and ending height, or until the cap is reached, whichever comes first.

4. What is a Runestone? Runestones are the Rune protocol messages stored in the OP_RETURN output of the Rune transaction.

## Lunarbits Software and Technical Systems:
As of June 1st, 2025 Lunarbits operates no software,  operates no DIFI bridges or blockchain payment gateways , operates no DAO software, operates no airdrop software,  operates no third pary wallets as of June 1st, 2025  and as such  did not need any blockchain audits done and believes that Runes and Luminex.io audits may be done by third party platforms and wallets such as luminex.io and Xverse.app . In the future when lunarbits develops its own appsandv payment systems for redemption of Lunarbits on its third party e-commerce partners  it will update such public interest  information here along with audits, dev lab notes appropriately done by reliable third parties.

## DAO
A Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), or DAO, is a type of organization that operates using rules encoded in usually in smart contracts on a blockchain. Essentially, it's an organization run by its members/stakeholders, with decisions made collectively, often through token-based voting, and without a central authority. 

The Lunarbits advisory team has deemed that premature modification and inflexible rule making  and launching of  DAO without at least a 1 to 2 year study and consensus and participation of the community with feedback on what the community deems are important guardrails for long term community involvement, is not advisable and cited numerous examples of premature launched DAO programs that were not in the the long term interests of an evolving community.

Here's a more detailed breakdown:

Decentralized:

DAOs operate without a central governing body but often an advisory committee formed early on helps to be a steering commmitee to organize the DAO and get it operating. Decisions are made by the members of the organization, often through voting on proposals.

Autonomous:

Once the rules are set in the smart contracts, the DAO operates automatically, without needing human intervention or a central authority. 
Organization:

DAOs can be formed for various purposes, like managing a treasury, developing software, or even running a community. 
Blockchain:

The core technology that enables DAOs is the blockchain. It provides a transparent and immutable record of all transactions and decisions made within the DAO. 

Smart Contracts:

These are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code. They automate the rules of the DAO and ensure they are followed. 
Token-based Governance:

Many DAOs use tokens that represent voting power or ownership. Members can use these tokens to propose changes or vote on decisions within the organization. 

The Lunarbits Foundation, setting up the initial DAO,  holds no stake in Lunarbits tokens, has no beneficial owners or shareholders, and was created as an unincorporated sovereign trust, established in August 2024, solely for the purpose of developing and modifying the initial establishment of a DAO for the benefit of the Lunarbits stakeholder community. It has no authority over wallet signatories and is led by a maximum of 12 board advisors (currently 6 as of June 2025), all of whom are experienced in the cryptocurrency, media, and technology industries.

The Lunarbits Foundation also has the authority to elect non-interested, qualified escrow parties and custodial companies (such as Coinbase, or Gemini or other qualified custodians)  to manage the release of treasury of Lunarbits, including escrow and/or smart contracts for future airdrop allocations, rewards, liquidity reserves, fundraising reserves, and Lunarbits reserved for grants. This election will be simultaneous to the initial launch of Lunarbits on tier 1 abd 2 cryptocurrebcy exchanges and such companies will be revealed to the public.

The Foundation will meet monthly including virtually to discuss and deliberate the development of the final proposed DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization),rules which will go online no later than 12 months (365 days) following the initial public offering of Lunarbits on exchanges. The DAO is planned to determine key matters voted on, including the rules for future rewards and airdrops each year, the rules to be established for grants to qualified ecosystem partnerships that may add significant value, and the guidelines for establishing key projects to be developed for technology and infrastructure. The board of advisors shall establish such governance rules by ratification through a majority vote of the advisors prior to the DAO launch date. Ongoing governance shall be as codified by these final rules. It is the consensus of the advisors as of 2024 that the Lunarbits project shoukd be first launched, and have experience of minimum one year with its community to study and codify the final rules of the DAO.

The Lunarbits Adivors and initial DAO guidlines  to be developed to date and key affairs that are involved with is as pulbished on the Lunarbits Official website.

The advisors shall also determine any appropriate vendors to be employed to build software systems during the yea (s) followings the public event. The members of the board of advisors shall be published publicly and updated from time to time. After the establishment of the DAO, a group of qualified advisors shall continue to oversee the development of critical infrastructure and the growth of the Lunarbits community.

## FAQ

#### What protocol is used for Lunarbits?

Lunarbits is built on the Bitcoin Ordinals Runes Protocol.

#### What is a bitcoin ordinal and what is the Runes Protocol?

Bitcoin ordinals are a very popular NFT inscription system and the Runes Protocol built on Bitcoin Ordinals tokenizes and creates the utility token for use in the project  ecosystem.
### Are there audits of the actual Lunarbits Mine. 
Lunarbis does not hold any sofwate involved in the process of its mint of the Lunarbits Bitcoin Runes nor he custody of any of he lunarbits in third party wallets. The transaction was completed an a launch pad facilitated by the trusted third party. interested parties may inspect luminex reporting. documentations and audits on its website.

#### Are $Lunarbits really also a measurement of actual analog space on the moon which landed in the Lunaprise time capsule and space mission in 2024?

Yes, that is true, the Lunaprise mission launched on SpaceX Falcon9 (IM-1 Mission)  managed and curated by Space Blue sent Lunarbits digital artifacts inked to QR codes which take up measurable space in the lunar payload now sitting in the Lunaprise museum on the Moon.

The Odysseus lander became the first US spacecraft to land on the Moon since 1972.

The disks (18 layers of them contained in the Lunaprise) were inscribed with QR Codes which are linked as twins to the Lunarbits NFT images on Earth now inscribed as Bicoin Ordinal $Lunarbits tokens.

The total amount of Lunarbits authorized is currently 222.222 Million tokens. Every Lunarbit  has a twin of itself in the space on the Moon linked to the QR codes in the time capsule, making this the first out-of-this-world super rare tokenized bitcoin runes offered to earthlings!

#### Where can $Lunarbits be redeemed?

On offers at partner sites as listed and updated at www.lunarbits222.com/partnerships

#### What cryptocurrency exchange will list the token?

The Lunarbits Token has applied amd approved to  to list on a leading cryptocurrency platform such as MEXC, Gate.io,  LA Bank abd others and expects to be published there by start of Q3, 2025 (note this date is subject to change)
