# Lunarbits

Background of Soace Launched Event That Launched The Bitcoin Built Memecoin.



Lunarbits were launched inbedded with QR codes inscribed on nickel disks launched in a timecapsule (Lunaprise IM-1 Mision). The time capsule was bolted to the Odessyus lunar lander launched to the moon atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 in a private payload landing on the south pole of the moon on 2.22 i.e., February 22nd, 2024. The project was curated by Space Blue (but now owned by) , a space and content company and a community quickly evolved supporting the launch of a memecoin. The project is not authored ot curated by SpaceX or NASA and is psrt of the first private commercial space mission to land on the moon in 50 years for NASA , The USA and private funded projects.


Space Blue maintains a registry of official Payloads of content it curated and stored in the time capsule and their metadata which landed on the moon:

Lunarbits verification can be obtained there of its payload inscribed and sent to the moon by entering the name Lunarbits in the verification query and/or payload ID of 244. 

Lunarbits now also on earth have been memorialized  and inscribed as Bitcoin Tokens using q protocol developed in 2024 called Bitcoin Runes and were inscribed on August 8th, 2024. The Bitcoin Runes Protocol is not created or authored by Lunarbits and was inscribed on a third party trusted Bitcoin inscription platform called Luminex.


222 commemorates the date of 2.22 (February 22, 2024) in which 222 art, Bitcoin and digital projects landed in a timecapsule on the moo [Lunaprise -IM1 Mission] including the Lunarbits project.

## Current $Lunarbits Tokenomics:
Total Supply Authorized 222 Million

Total Issued Initial Year 1 (2024-202): 22.22 Million Maximun.

Remaining 200 Million Lunarbits Maximun Issue Pro Rated Over 10 years

Lunarbits was pre mined on the Luninex platform, a third party widely used and trusted in the bitcoin ordinals and bitcoin runes community.

## The Bitcoin Runes Protocol

Introduction to Runes:

The Bitcoin Runes Protocol is not created or authored by Lunarbits and was inscribed on a third party trusted Bitcoin inscription platform called Luminex. Lunarbits is not its own protocol but rather is a token project inscribed on the Bitcoin network using the inscription tool launched by Luminex 

Runes is a fungible token protocol for the Bitcoin network that aims to be simple and UTXO-based. Rune balances are held by UTXOs, and transactions are identified using specific script conditions. Luminex laubched in April, 2024 a set of Rune tools, allowing the Lunarbits team to  etch, mint and transfer its Lunarbits Bitcoin Runes Tokens to its initial treasury wallet. 


Runes were officially released on Bitcoin mainnet at block 840,000,in April 2024.


Interested parties can discover Lunarbits mint verufication verified on many bitcoin runes explorers including on Luminex where parties can inspect; 

1. Lunarbits initial closed mint. was on the final closed mint on August 8th, 2024 lunarbits adnistratrators transferred all 222 million Lunarbits tokens to the initial treasury wallet 

2  Luminex Explorer
Allows the public to see overview of many Runes projects,and Runes and Ordinals addresses. With summaries es to holdings, estimated net worth, and balances.

4. Luminex Audit and Documentation. Lminex has conducted audits of its software systen used to mint Lunarbits and other Runes projects and such audits are available on their website and github.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
1. What is Rune?
RUNE is a UTXO-based fungible token protocol for the Bitcoin network. It allows for the issuance and management of tokens within the Bitcoin ecosystem.

2. What's the difference between Open Mint, Premine and Closed Mint?

Open Mint: A rune that is available to mint from any address through an on-chain Rune transaction and allocate a fixed amount of new units for themselves. There is no mint price going to whoever deployed the Rune. An open mint is subject to the Mint Terms.

Premine: The deployer of the Rune can decide to allocate to themselves an amount of Runes within the Etching transaction. This allocation is called Premine.

Closed Mint: A rune can be fully pre-mined within the Etching transaction. The total supply will be equal to the premine allocation of the etcher.

Lunarbirs is a closed mint premined. evidence of that can be seen in the inscription proof.

4. What are the Mint Terms? These are the rules that determine when an open mint opens or closes. For example, a mint may be limited to a starting height, an ending height, and a cap, and will be open between the starting height and ending height, or until the cap is reached, whichever comes first.


5. What is a Runestone? Runestones are the Rune protocol messages stored in the OP_RETURN output of the Rune transaction.




## Lunarbits Software and Technical Systems:
Lunarbits operates no software,  operates no difl bridges , operates no DAO softwaree, operates no airdrop software,  operates no third pary wallets as of June 1st, 2025  and as such  does not need any audits done . In the future when it develops payment systems for redemption of Kunarbits on its third party e commerce partners  it will update such public interest  information here along with audits appropriately done by reliable third parties.

## Software and Infrastructure In Development. 

Lumarbits is currently building e-commerce software that will Lunarbits stakeholders to use e commerce gateways for its partner offerings. Thd forecasted launch of such applications is  Q4-2025.

DAO Platform: Lunarbits expects to start and complete the build of a DAO software systen which it plans to launch and operate in 2026.


## DAO
A Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), or DAO, is a type of organization that operates using rules encoded in smart contracts on a blockchain. Essentially, it's an organization run by its members, with decisions made collectively, often through token-based voting, and without a central authority. 

Here's a more detailed breakdown:

Decentralized:

DAOs operate without a central governing body. Decisions are made by the members of the organization, often through voting on proposals. 
Autonomous:

Once the rules are set in the smart contracts, the DAO operates automatically, without needing human intervention or a central authority. 
Organization:

DAOs can be formed for various purposes, like managing a treasury, developing software, or even running a community. 
Blockchain:

The core technology that enables DAOs is the blockchain. It provides a transparent and immutable record of all transactions and decisions made within the DAO. 
Smart Contracts:

These are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code. They automate the rules of the DAO and ensure they are followed. 
Token-based Governance:

Many DAOs use tokens that represent voting power or ownership. Members can use these tokens to propose changes or vote on decisions within the organization. 

The Lunarbits Foundation, setting uo the initial DAO,  holds no stake in Lunarbits tokens, has no beneficial owners or shareholders, and was created as an unincorporated sovereign trust, established in August 2024, solely for the purpose of developing and modifying the initial establishment of a DAO for the benefit of the Lunarbits stakeholder community. It has no authority over wallet signatories and is led by a maximum of 12 board advisors (currently 6 as of June 2025), all of whom are experienced in the cryptocurrency, media, and technology industries.

The Lunarbits Foundation also has the authority to elect non-interested, qualified escrow parties and custodial companies  to manage the treasury of Lunarbits, including escrow and/or smart contracts for airdrop allocations, rewards, liquidity reserves, fundraising reserves, and Lunarbits reserved for grants. This election will be simtanrous to the initial launch of Lunarbits on tier 1 abd 2 cryptocurrebcy exchanges and such companies will be revealed to the public.


The Foundation meets monthly including virtually to discuss and deliberate the development of the final proposed DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization),rules which will go online no later than 12 months (365 days) following the initial public offering of Lunarbits on exchanges. The DAO is planned to determine key matters voted on, including the rules for future rewards and airdrops each year, the rules to be established for grants to qualified ecosystem partnerships that may add significant value, and the guidelines for establishing key projects to be developed for technology and infrastructure. The board of advisors shall establish such governance rules by ratification through a majority vote of the advisors prior to the DAO launch date. Ongoing governance shall be as codified by these final rules. It is the consensus of the advisors as of 2024 that the Lunarbits project shoukd be first launched, and have experience of minimum lme year with its community to study and codify the final rules of the DAO.

The advisors shall also determine any appropriate vendors to be employed to build software systems during the yea (s) followings the public event. The members of the board of advisors shall be published publicly and updated from time to time. After the establishment of the DAO, a group of qualified advisors shall continue to oversee the development of critical infrastructure and the growth of the Lunarbits community.

## FAQ


#### What protocol is used for Lunarbits?

Lunarbits is built on the Bitcoin Ordinals Runes Protocol.

#### What is a bitcoin ordinal and what is the Runes Protocol?

Bitcoin ordinals are a very popular NFT inscription system and the Runes Protocol built on Bitcoin Ordinals tokenizes and creates the utility token for use in the project  ecosystem.

#### Are $Lunarbits really also a measurement of actual analog space on the moon which landed in the Lunaprise time capsule and space mission in 2024?

Yes, that is true, the Lunaprise mission launched on SpaceX Falcon9 (IM-1 Mission)  managed and curated by Space Blue sent Lunarbits digital artifacts inked to QR codes which take up measurable space in the lunar payload now sitting in the Lunaprise museum on the Moon.

The Odysseus lander became the first US spacecraft to land on the Moon since 1972.

The Lunaprise disks (18 layers of them) were inscribed with QR Codes which are linked as twins to the Lunarbits NFT images on Earth now inscribed as Bicoin Ordinal $Lunarbits utility tokens.

The total amount of Lunarbits authorized is currently 222 Million tokens. Every Lunarbit reward has a twin of itself in the space on the Moon linked to the QR codes in the time capsule, making this the first out-of-this-world super rare tokenized reward offered to earthlings!
