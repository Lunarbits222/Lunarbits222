ACQUIRE-EARN-EXPERIENCE
The first Moon launched Bitcoin Ordinal Runes token rewards, out of this world!
Lunarbits were launched on the SpaceX Falcon 9 in a private payload (Lunaprise Mission) curated by Space Blue and now their twins have been inscribed as Bitcoin Ordinals as a Bitcoin Ordinal Runes token reward for the Space Blue artist ecosystem.

Lunarbits twin digital assets were sent to Moon and landed in Lunaprise Museum on South Pole of Moon on February 22nd, 2024. The first Lunar landing for USA since 1972.


222 commemorates the date of 2.22 (February 22, 2024) in which 222 art, Bitcoin and digital projects were archived in the Moon Museum [Lunaprise -IM1] including the Lunarbits project.

## DAO
A Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), or DAO, is a type of organization that operates using rules encoded in smart contracts on a blockchain. Essentially, it's an organization run by its members, with decisions made collectively, often through token-based voting, and without a central authority. 

Here's a more detailed breakdown:
Decentralized:
.
DAOs operate without a central governing body. Decisions are made by the members of the organization, often through voting on proposals. 
Autonomous:
.
Once the rules are set in the smart contracts, the DAO operates automatically, without needing human intervention or a central authority. 
Organization:
.
DAOs can be formed for various purposes, like managing a treasury, developing software, or even running a community. 
Blockchain:
.
The core technology that enables DAOs is the blockchain. It provides a transparent and immutable record of all transactions and decisions made within the DAO. 
Smart Contracts:
.
These are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code. They automate the rules of the DAO and ensure they are followed. 
Token-based Governance:
.
Many DAOs use tokens that represent voting power or ownership. Members can use these tokens to propose changes or vote on decisions within the organization. 

The Lunarbits Foundation, setting uo the initial DAO holds no stake in Lunarbits tokens, has no beneficial owners or shareholders, and was created as an unincorporated sovereign trust, established in August 2024, solely for the purpose of developing and modifying the initial establishment of a DAO for the benefit of the Lunarbits stakeholder community. It has no authority over wallet signatories and is led by a maximum of 12 board advisors (currently 6 as of June 2025), all of whom are experienced in the cryptocurrency, media, and technology industries.

The Lunarbits Foundation also has the authority to elect non-interested, qualified escrow parties and custodial companies  to manage the treasury of Lunarbits, including escrow and/or smart contracts for airdrop allocations, rewards, liquidity reserves, fundraising reserves, and Lunarbits reserved for grants. This election will be simtanrous to the initial launch of Lunarbits on tier 1 abd 2 cryptocurrebcy exchanges and such companies will be revealed to the public.


The Foundation meets monthly including virtually to discuss and deliberate the development of the final proposed DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization),rules which will go online no later than 12 months (365 days) following the initial public offering of Lunarbits on exchanges. The DAO is planned to determine key matters voted on, including the rules for future rewards and airdrops each year, the rules to be established for grants to qualified ecosystem partnerships that may add significant value, and the guidelines for establishing key projects to be developed for technology and infrastructure. The board of advisors shall establish such governance rules by ratification through a majority vote of the advisors prior to the DAO launch date. Ongoing governance shall be as codified by these final rules. It is the consensus of the advisors as of 2024 that the Lunarbits project shoukd be first launched, and have experience of minimum lme year with its community to study and codify the final rules of the DAO.

The advisors shall also determine any appropriate vendors to be employed to build software systems during the yea (s) followings the public event. The members of the board of advisors shall be published publicly and updated from time to time. After the establishment of the DAO, a group of qualified advisors shall continue to oversee the development of critical infrastructure and the growth of the Lunarbits community.

## FAQ


#### What protocol is used for Lunarbits?

Lunarbits is built on the Bitcoin Ordinals Runes Protocol.

#### What is a bitcoin ordinal and what is the Runes Protocol?

Bitcoin ordinals are a very popular NFT inscription system and the Runes Protocol built on Bitcoin Ordinals tokenizes and creates the utility token for use in the project  ecosystem.

#### Are $Lunarbits really also a measurement of actual analog space on the moon which landed in the Lunaprise time capsule and space mission in 2024?

Yes, that is true, the Lunaprise mission launched on SpaceX Falcon9 (IM-1 Mission)  managed and curated by Space Blue sent Lunarbits digital artifacts inked to QR codes which take up measurable space in the lunar payload now sitting in the Lunaprise museum on the Moon.

The Odysseus lander became the first US spacecraft to land on the Moon since 1972.

The Lunaprise disks (18 layers of them) were inscribed with QR Codes which are linked as twins to the Lunarbits NFT images on Earth now inscribed as Bicoin Ordinal $Lunarbits utility tokens.

The total amount of Lunarbits authorized is currently 222 Million tokens. Every Lunarbit reward has a twin of itself in the space on the Moon linked to the QR codes in the time capsule, making this the first out-of-this-world super rare tokenized reward offered to earthlings!

#### Where can $Lunarbits be redeemed?

On offers at www.nftblue.com buy art, buy digital art, and merchandise.

On offers at www.spaceblue.club ( participate in events and experiences related to the space art community)

And at participating partners online and worldwide.
