A Cryptocurrency Project and  Token Literally Born on the Moon
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d49d57dc-cc0b-4256-9a76-16e923bc6065)

Built first on Bitcoin Runes.
Expanded with the multichain initiative to include LBITS, Lunarbits Solana in November 2025. Added in January , 2026 a bitcoin runes inscribed token named Lunarbits Equity Fund, a RWA real world asset tokenized equity fund, and deemed a security token for qualified investors only as it has dividends and rewards and payouts planned. 

# Lunarbits Historic Lunar Space Background

Lunarbits were launched embedded with QR codes inscribed on nickel disks inside a time capsule (Lunaprise IM-1 Mission). The time capsule, which contained bitcoin projects including the first bitcoin whitepaper to land on the moon,  was bolted to the Odessyus Lunar Lander. On February 15th, 2025, the payload was launched to the moon atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 in a private sector mission, landing on the south pole of the moon on 2.22 February 22nd, 2024. The time capsule project was curated by Space Blue, a private space and content company ( along with Galactic Legacy Labs, the payload partner), and a community quickly evolved , supporting the launch of the first bitcoin memecoin born on the moon. The Lunarbits project is community-driven and not authored or curated by SpaceX or NASA, and is part of the first private commercial space mission to land on the moon in 50 years for NASA, the USA, and privately funded projects like Space Blue's initiatives to land art, commercial content and bitcoin projects on the moon.

Space Blue, as the only authorized party for certifications of assets in the Lunaprise time capsule,  maintains a registry of official payloads of content it curated and stored in the time capsule and their metadata, which landed on the moon at:
https://verify.spaceblue.club/ 
Further information on the space mission itself can be found online at https://github.com/lunaprise and https://spaceblue.club


Lunarbits verification can be obtained there of its payload, which is inscribed and sent to the moon by entering the name Lunarbits in the verification query and/or payload ID of 244. 

Lunarbits, now also on Earth, have been memorialized  and inscribed as Bitcoin Tokens using a protocol developed by the Bitcoin Ordinals community in 2024 called Bitcoin Runes and were inscribed  as Lunarbits on August 2nd, 2024. The Bitcoin Runes Protocol is not created or authored by Lunarbits, and thus Lunarbits is inscribed on a third-party trusted Bitcoin inscription platform called Luminex, which as of this date, Luminex.io has launched tens of thousands of inscription projects on its platform.

222 commemorates the date of 2.22 (February 22, 2024) in which 222 art, Bitcoin, and digital projects landed in a time capsule on the moon [Lunaprise -IM1 Mission], including the Lunarbits project

##  LBITS MULTICHAIN UPDATE:
LBITS, A multichain initiative inscribing 22.22 million ecosystem rewards tokens on Solana, was launched by Lunarbits. Lunarbits announced a long-awaited introduction of Lunarbits Engagement and Rewards Token to be minted on the Solana network in a TGE-Token Generation Event, known as Lunarbits (SOL). The TGE is forecasted to take place in November 2025, and the smart contract address and tokenomics of such will be updated here at that time. The Lunarbits (SOL) under the token symbol LBITS is not intended to replace the ecosystem of Lunarbits Bitcoin Runes but rather expand the community and invite further engagement in order to be eligible for rewards.

## LBITS SOLANA MINT DID NOT INCREASE OVERALL TOKEN SUPPLY AND HERE IS WHY:
Lunarbits Foundation, concurrent with the introduction of 22.22 LBITS Solana Tokens in November 2025, agreed to hold back from the Lunarbits Treasury 22.22 Million Lunarbits Bitcoin Runes tokens for potential burning of such if the DAO, within 2 years of the ICO, deems it in the best interests of the community to maintain the total number of Lunarbits Bitcoin Runes and LBITS Solana tokens to be the tokenomics origins of 222,222 Million tokens.

Total Reserved Tokens Across Multiple Reserve Wallets, i.e, Minimum   197.77 million Lunarbits are to be transferred to an escrowed third-party qualified financial institution (such as Coinbase, or Gemini or other) cold wallet storage during year 1 after  the Lunarnits public listing, as per Lunarbits DAO Foundation Advisory Guidelines and released per the release schedule each year as determined by the DAO, which may also determine to burn certain reserved Lunarbits tokens. 

## LBITS AND THE SOLANA NETWORK

Background: 
The Solana Network and Protocol
The Solana blockchain represents a paradigm shift in distributed ledger technology, designed to address the longstanding scalability trilemma—balancing decentralization, security, and performance—that has plagued earlier networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Founded in 2017 by Anatoly Yakovenko and a team of former Qualcomm engineers, Solana Labs aimed to create a global-scale infrastructure capable of supporting decentralized applications (dApps) at internet speeds. Launched in March 2020, the Solana mainnet has since evolved into a robust Layer-1 protocol, processing over 2,000 transactions per second (TPS) on average, with theoretical peaks exceeding 65,000 TPS, while maintaining sub-second finality and transaction fees averaging less than $0.00025.

At its core, Solana's protocol innovations distinguish it from traditional blockchains. It employs a hybrid consensus mechanism combining Proof of Stake (PoS) with Proof of History (PoH), a novel time-stamping protocol that Yakovenko patented in 2018. PoH functions as a verifiable delay function, generating a historical record of events by hashing timestamps into a sequential chain, effectively creating a decentralized clock without relying on synchronized nodes. This eliminates the need for constant communication between validators to establish temporal order, drastically reducing latency and bandwidth overhead. PoH is complemented by Tower BFT, a PoS variant of Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT), which uses the historical proofs from PoH to achieve consensus in fewer rounds—typically 2-3 slots per block—ensuring rapid finality while tolerating up to one-third faulty validators.

Solana's architecture further optimizes throughput through a suite of purpose-built components.

Solana's architecture enables it to handle high-volume use cases, from DeFi and NFTs to gaming and payments, while preserving decentralization—over 1,500 independent validators secure the network as of late 2025.006113c806ec The protocol's energy efficiency, driven by PoS, aligns with sustainable blockchain trends, consuming approximately 0.001 kWh per transaction compared to Bitcoin's proof-of-work equivalent.2929f5 

Despite occasional network congestion during peak adoption (e.g., meme coin frenzies in 2024-2025), Solana's Firedancer upgrade— a Rust-based validator client from Jump Crypto—has enhanced resilience, targeting 1 million TPS in future iterations.

Solana's ecosystem has flourished, attracting over $10 billion in total value locked (TVL) and powering projects in capital markets, real-world assets (RWAs), and consumer applications. Its permissionless nature and low barriers to entry have democratized blockchain development, fostering innovation in high-frequency trading, cross-border remittances, and community-driven tokens.

LBITS: Leveraging Solana's Solutions for Meme Coin Ecosystem Rewards
Building on Solana's high-performance foundation, the LBITS project emerges as an innovative multichain meme coin initiative spearheaded by Lunarbits—a Singapore-based community of space enthusiasts, artists, musicians, and Bitcoin pioneers.

LBITS was launched on November 4, 2025. LBITS represents a strategic expansion of the Lunarbits ecosystem onto Solana, minting 22.22 million tokens as inscribed rewards for community contributors. Positioned as a meme coin with utility in ecosystem governance and incentives, LBITS draws inspiration from viral Solana phenomena like BONK and WIF, but differentiates through its multichain interoperability—bridging Bitcoin Runes origins with Solana's speed. The total supply of 22.22 million echoes Lunarbits' lunar motif (22.22 symbolizing orbital cycles), with allocations for airdrops, staking rewards, and creator grants to fuel a "moonshot" economy of art, music, and space-themed dApps.

LBITS harnesses Solana's protocol solutions to overcome the limitations inherent in meme coin launches on less scalable chains:
High Throughput and Low Latency via PoH and Turbine: Solana's ability to process thousands of TPS enables seamless, real-time distribution of the 22.22 million LBITS rewards. PoH's timestamping ensures tamper-proof inscription of rewards, while Turbine's efficient propagation broadcasts claims network-wide without bottlenecks, ideal for viral, community-driven hype cycles characteristic of meme coins.

Cost Efficiency and Accessibility: With transaction fees under $0.00025, LBITS democratizes participation, allowing micro-transactions for staking, voting on ecosystem proposals, or tipping creators—features that would be prohibitive on higher-fee networks. This aligns with Lunarbits' inclusive vision, enabling global "pups" (community members) to engage without barriers.

Parallel Execution with Sealevel: LBITS smart contracts, deployed as Solana Programs, leverage parallel processing for concurrent reward calculations and multichain bridges. For instance, integrations with Wormhole or Allbridge facilitate atomic swaps between LBITS on Solana and Lunarbits Runes on Bitcoin, executing in parallel to minimize slippage during high-volume trades.47e616
Gulf Stream for Meme Velocity: By forwarding unconfirmed reward claims to validators pre-block, Gulf Stream ensures near-instant feedback loops, amplifying social virality. This was pivotal during LBITS' launch, where DEX listings on Raydium and Jupiter saw 500% volume spikes within minutes, powered by Solana's mempool optimization.

In essence, LBITS transforms Solana from a mere host into a launchpad for interstellar meme culture, using the protocol's innovations to scale rewards at lunar speeds. This synergy not only enhances liquidity and engagement but positions LBITS as a bridge between Bitcoin's security and Solana's velocity, fostering a trillion-dollar community ecosystem that rewards innovation across chains.96a652 Future developments, including LBITS-powered lunar NFT marketplaces and space-themed DeFi primitives, will further exploit Solana's scalability to propel the project toward its namesake destination.

## What Does"Multichain" Mean in Cryptocurrency?

In cryptocurrency, "multichain" refers to a strategy where a project, token, or application is deployed and operates across multiple blockchain networks simultaneously, rather than being limited to a single chain. This approach leverages the unique strengths of different blockchains—such as varying transaction speeds, costs, security models, or ecosystems—while enabling interoperability through bridges, wrapped tokens, or cross-chain protocols. For example, a token might exist natively on Bitcoin for its security and store-of-value appeal, while also being available on Ethereum or Solana for faster, cheaper interactions in DeFi or NFTs. The goal is often to expand reach, liquidity, and utility without fragmenting the project's core value.

## Why Multichain Could Be Good for LunarBits' Expansion (Bitcoin Runes + LBITS on Solana)
LunarBits is a Bitcoin-native token built on the Runes protocol—a fungible token standard launched on Bitcoin to enable efficient, UTXO-based assets without relying on sidechains or complex smart contracts. It's a community-driven project blending space exploration, art, music, and Bitcoin culture, with real-world ties like artifacts launched on SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket and a historic "Lunaprise" mission landing on the Moon via Intuitive Machines' IM-1. Recently, on November 4, 2025, the project expanded by minting LBITS—a Solana-based version—with 22.22 million tokens (6 decimals) to create a multichain presence. This pairs the original LUNARBITS on Bitcoin Runes with LBITS on Solana, allowing seamless operation across both ecosystems.

This multichain setup is a smart move for LunarBits' growth, especially given its thematic focus on "Bitcoin to the Moon" and cultural artifacts. Here are key reasons why it could drive expansion:

## Broader User Acquisition and Accessibility: 

Bitcoin Runes appeals to hardcore Bitcoin maximalists who value decentralization and scarcity, but Solana's high-speed (up to 65,000 TPS) and low-fee (~$0.00025 per transaction) environment attracts DeFi enthusiasts, NFT traders, and retail users who might find Bitcoin's slower speeds (7 TPS) and higher fees prohibitive for everyday use. By offering LBITS on Solana, LunarBits taps into Solana's 50M+ active wallets (vs. Bitcoin's more conservative base), potentially onboarding millions who align with the project's space-art vibe through Solana's vibrant meme coin and creator economy scenes.

## Enhanced Liquidity and Trading Opportunities:

Operating on multiple chains fragments liquidity risks but multiplies pools. LUNARBITS can trade on Bitcoin-focused marketplaces like Magic Eden's Runes section, while LBITS unlocks Solana DEXes (e.g., Raydium, Jupiter) with deeper liquidity and automated market makers. This cross-chain flow—via bridges like Wormhole or Mayan—could boost overall volume; for instance, LunarBits' recent multiverse launch event highlighted LBITS powering music, movies, and art experiences on Solana, drawing in new traders and increasing 24-hour volumes that have hovered around $200K+ for the project.

## Ecosystem Diversification and Risk Mitigation: 

Relying solely on Bitcoin exposes projects to network congestion (e.g., during halvings or Ordinals hype) or scalability limits. Solana's proof-of-history consensus complements Bitcoin's proof-of-work security, reducing downtime risks—Solana has averaged 99.9% uptime in 2025. For LunarBits, this means reliable hosting for space-themed dApps, like virtual moon museums or creator rewards, without Bitcoin's volatility in fees. It also hedges against chain-specific regulations; Bitcoin's "digital gold" status pairs with Solana's innovation-friendly vibe.

Overall, this multichain pivot positions LunarBits as a bridge between Bitcoin's foundational security and Solana's explosive growth, potentially scaling its market cap while staying true to its cosmic, community roots.


### Burning Provision for Lunarbits Treasury Reserve:

To enhance the Lunarbits tokenomics and create deflationary pressure that could potentially increase token value over time, implementing effective token-burning strategies is a strong approach. Token burning involves permanently removing tokens from circulation, reducing the total supply, and signaling scarcity to investors. A burn proposal is being considered by the Lunarbits advisory team, and such proposals and new proposals will likely be a part of the DAO voting process. Learn more about the first such burn proposal at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bJxL_VNfzsQH440dlbZHcDXWfCRSfGpsmiCnSeug_ug/edit?usp=sharing


## Lunarbits Bitcoin Runes Mint
Additional methods to prove the Lunarbits Bitcoin Runes mint:

Auditing a Bitcoin Runes project inscribed on Luminex.io, when Luminex when minting is not controlled by the project team, is feasible by leveraging Bitcoin’s blockchain transparency and alternative tools. Key steps include verifying the etching transaction, tracing minting activity, auditing Runestone security, assessing the team and third-party minting, and checking market health. Tools like ordiscan.com, Mempool.space, GeniiData, RuneScan, and Runes Indexer replace Luminex’s dashboard, while security firms ensure thorough analysis. For third-party minting, cross-reference logs with on-chain data and audit their security. To reduce risks, use multi-sig wallets, pre-audit Runestones, monitor transactions, and rely on decentralized indexers. This approach ensures a robust audit, even in challenging conditions, protecting investors and users.

## The Bitcoin Runes Protocol

Introduction to Runes:

The Bitcoin Runes Protocol was not created or authored by Lunarbits. Lunarbits were inscribed on a third-party trusted Bitcoin Runes inscription platform called Luminex. Lunarbits is not its own protocol but rather is a token project inscribed on the Bitcoin network using the inscription tool launched by Luminex. 

Runes is a fungible token protocol for the Bitcoin network that aims to be simple and UTXO-based. Rune balances are held by UTXOs, and transactions are identified using specific script conditions. Luminex launched in April 2024 a set of Rune tools, allowing the Lunarbits team to  etch, mint, and transfer its Lunarbits Bitcoin Runes Tokens to its initial treasury wallet. 


Interested parties can discover Lunarbits mint verification verified on many Bitcoin run explorers and decentralized wallets, such as Xverse,  Unisat, MagicEden, OKX,   and including on Luminex, where parties can inspect: 

1. Lunarbits' initial Bitcoin Runes closed mint. On the final closed mint on August 02, 2024, Lunarbits administrators transferred all 222.222 million Lunarbits tokens to the initial treasury wallet.

2. Luminex Explorer
Allows the public to see an overview of many Runes projects, and Runes and Ordinals addresses. With summaries as to holdings, estimated market cap, net worth, and balances by wallet holders.

3. Luminex Audit and Documentation. Lminex, if it conducted audits of its software system used to mint Lunarbits and other Runes projects, then such audits may be available on its website and GitHub.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
1. What is Rune?
RUNE is a UTXO-based fungible token protocol for the Bitcoin network. It allows for the issuance and management of tokens within the Bitcoin ecosystem.

2. What's the difference between Open Mint, Premine, and Closed Mint?

Open Mint: A rune that is available to mint from any address through an on-chain Rune transaction and allocate a fixed amount of new units for themselves. There is no mint price going to whoever deployed the Rune. An open mint is subject to the Mint Terms.

Premine: The deployer of the Rune can decide to allocate to themselves an amount of Runes within the Etching transaction. This allocation is called Premine.

Closed Mint: A rune can be fully pre-mined within the Etching transaction. The total supply will be equal to the premine allocation of the etcher.

Lunarbirs Bitcoin Runes is a closed mint, premined. Evidence of that can be seen in the inscription proof.

3. What are the Mint Terms? These are the rules that determine when an open mint opens or closes. For example, a mint may be limited to a starting height, an ending height, and a cap, and will be open between the starting height and ending height, or until the cap is reached, whichever comes first.

4. What is a Runestone? Runestones are the Rune protocol messages stored in the OP_RETURN output of the Rune transaction.

## BITCOIN BLOCKCHAIN SECURITY

As a Bitcoin Runes token, Lunarbits leverages Bitcoin’s L1 security, the most robust in crypto, reducing risks of hacks or double-spending. Its UTXO-based model integrates seamlessly with Bitcoin’s architecture, unlike the less efficient BRC-20 standard.

## Lunarbits Software and Technical Systems:
As of June 1st, 2025 Lunarbits operates no software,  operates no DIFI bridges or blockchain payment gateways, operates no DAO software, operates no airdrop software,  operates no third pary wallets as of June 1st, 2025  and as such  did not need any blockchain audits done and believes that Runes and Luminex.io audits may be done by third party platforms and wallets such as luminex.io and Xverse.app. In the future, when Lunarbits develops its own apps and payment systems for redemption of Lunarbits on its third-party e-commerce partners,  it will update such public interest  information here, along with audits, dev lab notes appropriately done by reliable third parties.

## Software and Infrastructure In Development. 

Lumarbits is currently building e-commerce software that will allow Lunarbits stakeholders to use e-commerce gateways for its partner offerings. The forecasted launch of such applications is  Q4-2025. Until such time.

Lunarbits stakeholders are eligible to participate in e-commerce partnerships listed at  https://lunarbits222.com/partnership/ through  OTC wallet-to-wallet transactions with private selling parties of art, collectibles, and  travel experiences.

DAO Platform: Lunarbits expects to start and complete the build of a DAO software system, which it plans to launch and operate in mid-2026.

## DAO
A Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), or DAO, is a type of organization that operates using rules encoded in usually in smart contracts on a blockchain. Essentially, it's an organization run by its members/stakeholders, with decisions made collectively, often through token-based voting, and without a central authority. 

The Lunarbits advisory team has deemed that premature modification and inflexible rule making  and launching of  DAO without at least a 1 to 2 year study and consensus and participation of the community with feedback on what the community deems are important guardrails for long term community involvement, is not advisable and cited numerous examples of premature launched DAO programs that were not in the the long term interests of an evolving community.

Here's a more detailed breakdown:

Decentralized:

DAOs operate without a central governing body, but often an advisory committee formed early on helps to be a steering committee to organize the DAO and get it operating. Decisions are made by the members of the organization, often through voting on proposals.

Autonomous:

Once the rules are set in the smart contracts, the DAO operates automatically, without needing human intervention or a central authority. 
Organization:

DAOs can be formed for various purposes, like managing a treasury, developing software, or even running a community. 
Blockchain:

The core technology that enables DAOs is the blockchain. It provides a transparent and immutable record of all transactions and decisions made within the DAO. 

Smart Contracts:

These are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code. They automate the rules of the DAO and ensure they are followed. 
Token-based Governance:

Many DAOs use tokens that represent voting power or ownership. Members can use these tokens to propose changes or vote on decisions within the organization. 

The Lunarbits Foundation, setting up the initial DAO,  holds no stake in Lunarbits tokens, has no beneficial owners or shareholders, and was created as an unincorporated sovereign trust, established in August 2024, solely for the purpose of developing and modifying the initial establishment of a DAO for the benefit of the Lunarbits stakeholder community. It has no authority over wallet signatories and is led by a maximum of 12 board advisors (currently 6 as of June 2025), all of whom are experienced in the cryptocurrency, media, and technology industries.

The Lunarbits Foundation also has the authority to elect non-interested, qualified escrow parties and custodial companies (such as Coinbase, Gemini, or other qualified custodians)  to manage the release of the treasury of Lunarbits, including escrow and/or smart contracts for future airdrop allocations, rewards, liquidity reserves, fundraising reserves, and Lunarbits reserved for grants. This election will be simultaneous to the initial launch of Lunarbits on tier 1 and 2 cryptocurrency exchanges, and such companies will be revealed to the public.

The Foundation will meet monthly, including virtually, to discuss and deliberate the development of the final proposed DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization), rules which will go online no later than 12 months (365 days) following the initial public offering of Lunarbits on exchanges. The DAO is planned to determine key matters voted on, including the rules for future rewards and airdrops each year, the rules to be established for grants to qualified ecosystem partnerships that may add significant value, and the guidelines for establishing key projects to be developed for technology and infrastructure. The board of advisors shall establish such governance rules by ratification through a majority vote of the advisors prior to the DAO launch date. Ongoing governance shall be as codified by these final rules. It is the consensus of the advisors as of 2024 that the Lunarbits project should be first launched, and have experience of minimum one year with its community to study and codify the final rules of the DAO.

The Lunarbits Advisors and initial DAO guidelines  have been developed to date, and key affairs that are involved with is as published on the Lunarbits Official website.

The advisors shall also determine any appropriate vendors to be employed to build software systems during the year (s) following the public event. The members of the board of advisors shall be published publicly and updated from time to time. After the establishment of the DAO, a group of qualified advisors shall continue to oversee the development of critical infrastructure and the growth of the Lunarbits community.
