# Lunarbits

Background of Soace Launched Event That Launched The Memecoin.

Lunarbits were launched inbedded with QR codes inscribed on nickel disks laubched in a timecapsule (Lunaprise IM-1 Mision)  atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 in a private payload landing on the south pole of the moon on 2.22 i.e., February 22nd, 2024. The project was curated by Space Blue space and content company and a community quickly evolved supporting the launch of a memecoin.

 Space Blue maintains a registry of official Payloads abd their metadata which landed on the moon:

Lunarbits verification can be obtained there of its payload inscribed and sent to the moon.

Lunarbits now have have been memorialized  and inscribed as Bitcoin Tokens using q protocol developed in 2024 called Bitcoin Runes and were inscribed on August 8th, 2024.


222 commemorates the date of 2.22 (February 22, 2024) in which 222 art, Bitcoin and digital projects landed in a timecapsule on the moo [Lunaprise -IM1 Mission] including the Lunarbits project.

## Current $Lunarbits Tokenomics:
Total Supply Authorized 222 Million

Total Issued Initial Year 1 (2024-202): 22.22 Million Maximun.

Lunarbits was pre mined on the Luninex platform, a third party widely used abd trusted in the bitcoin ordinals and bitcoin runes community.

## The Bitcoin Runes Protocol

Introduction to Runes
Runes is a fungible token protocol for the Bitcoin network that aims to be simple and UTXO-based. Rune balances are held by UTXOs, and transactions are identified using specific script conditions. Luminex is launching a set of Rune tools, allowing anyone to effortlessly etch, mint and transfer Runes.

Runes are set to be officially released on Bitcoin mainnet at block 840,000, around the 20th April 2024.

Before then, you can test Luminex Runes tools on the Bitcoin testnet at: LINK TO BE RELEASED

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
1. What is Rune?
RUNE is a UTXO-based fungible token protocol for the Bitcoin network. It allows for the issuance and management of tokens within the Bitcoin ecosystem.

2. Can RUNES be traded, transferred, or sold?
Many teams are working on integrating Runes within their platforms, like wallets, marketplaces, and more. We expect trading to commence once Runes are officially released on the mainnet.

3. What's the difference between Open Mint, Premine and Closed Mint?

Open Mint: A rune that is available to mint from any address through an on-chain Rune transaction and allocate a fixed amount of new units for themselves. There is no mint price going to whoever deployed the Rune. An open mint is subject to the Mint Terms.

Premine: The deployer of the Rune can decide to allocate to themselves an amount of Runes within the Etching transaction. This allocation is called Premine.

Closed Mint: A rune can be fully pre-mined within the Etching transaction. The total supply will be equal to the premine allocation of the etcher.

Lunarbirs is a closed mint premined. evidence of that can be seen in the inscription proof.

4. What are the Mint Terms? These are the rules that determine when an open mint opens or closes. For example, a mint may be limited to a starting height, an ending height, and a cap, and will be open between the starting height and ending height, or until the cap is reached, whichever comes first.


5. What is a Runestone? Runestones are the Rune protocol messages stored in the OP_RETURN output of the Rune transaction.

6. What is a Cenotaph? When a Runestone is malformed for whatever reason it is called a Cenotaph and in the event there is a Cenotaph all Runes in the transaction are burned

7. What happens if a person transfers a UTXO containing RUNE without the OP_RETURN R?
If you transfer a UTXO with Rune without the requisite OP_RETURN R, all Runes in that UTXO will be transferred to the first non OP_RETURN output. We recommend setting up a new address exclusively for receiving Ruens and refraining from transferring any UTXO from there until there's wallet integration.

## DAO
A Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), or DAO, is a type of organization that operates using rules encoded in smart contracts on a blockchain. Essentially, it's an organization run by its members, with decisions made collectively, often through token-based voting, and without a central authority. 

Here's a more detailed breakdown:

Decentralized:

DAOs operate without a central governing body. Decisions are made by the members of the organization, often through voting on proposals. 
Autonomous:

Once the rules are set in the smart contracts, the DAO operates automatically, without needing human intervention or a central authority. 
Organization:

DAOs can be formed for various purposes, like managing a treasury, developing software, or even running a community. 
Blockchain:

The core technology that enables DAOs is the blockchain. It provides a transparent and immutable record of all transactions and decisions made within the DAO. 
Smart Contracts:

These are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code. They automate the rules of the DAO and ensure they are followed. 
Token-based Governance:

Many DAOs use tokens that represent voting power or ownership. Members can use these tokens to propose changes or vote on decisions within the organization. 

The Lunarbits Foundation, setting uo the initial DAO,  holds no stake in Lunarbits tokens, has no beneficial owners or shareholders, and was created as an unincorporated sovereign trust, established in August 2024, solely for the purpose of developing and modifying the initial establishment of a DAO for the benefit of the Lunarbits stakeholder community. It has no authority over wallet signatories and is led by a maximum of 12 board advisors (currently 6 as of June 2025), all of whom are experienced in the cryptocurrency, media, and technology industries.

The Lunarbits Foundation also has the authority to elect non-interested, qualified escrow parties and custodial companies  to manage the treasury of Lunarbits, including escrow and/or smart contracts for airdrop allocations, rewards, liquidity reserves, fundraising reserves, and Lunarbits reserved for grants. This election will be simtanrous to the initial launch of Lunarbits on tier 1 abd 2 cryptocurrebcy exchanges and such companies will be revealed to the public.


The Foundation meets monthly including virtually to discuss and deliberate the development of the final proposed DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization),rules which will go online no later than 12 months (365 days) following the initial public offering of Lunarbits on exchanges. The DAO is planned to determine key matters voted on, including the rules for future rewards and airdrops each year, the rules to be established for grants to qualified ecosystem partnerships that may add significant value, and the guidelines for establishing key projects to be developed for technology and infrastructure. The board of advisors shall establish such governance rules by ratification through a majority vote of the advisors prior to the DAO launch date. Ongoing governance shall be as codified by these final rules. It is the consensus of the advisors as of 2024 that the Lunarbits project shoukd be first launched, and have experience of minimum lme year with its community to study and codify the final rules of the DAO.

The advisors shall also determine any appropriate vendors to be employed to build software systems during the yea (s) followings the public event. The members of the board of advisors shall be published publicly and updated from time to time. After the establishment of the DAO, a group of qualified advisors shall continue to oversee the development of critical infrastructure and the growth of the Lunarbits community.

## FAQ


#### What protocol is used for Lunarbits?

Lunarbits is built on the Bitcoin Ordinals Runes Protocol.

#### What is a bitcoin ordinal and what is the Runes Protocol?

Bitcoin ordinals are a very popular NFT inscription system and the Runes Protocol built on Bitcoin Ordinals tokenizes and creates the utility token for use in the project  ecosystem.

#### Are $Lunarbits really also a measurement of actual analog space on the moon which landed in the Lunaprise time capsule and space mission in 2024?

Yes, that is true, the Lunaprise mission launched on SpaceX Falcon9 (IM-1 Mission)  managed and curated by Space Blue sent Lunarbits digital artifacts inked to QR codes which take up measurable space in the lunar payload now sitting in the Lunaprise museum on the Moon.

The Odysseus lander became the first US spacecraft to land on the Moon since 1972.

The Lunaprise disks (18 layers of them) were inscribed with QR Codes which are linked as twins to the Lunarbits NFT images on Earth now inscribed as Bicoin Ordinal $Lunarbits utility tokens.

The total amount of Lunarbits authorized is currently 222 Million tokens. Every Lunarbit reward has a twin of itself in the space on the Moon linked to the QR codes in the time capsule, making this the first out-of-this-world super rare tokenized reward offered to earthlings!

#### Where can $Lunarbits be redeemed?

On offers at www.nftblue.com buy art, buy digital art, and merchandise.

On offers at www.spaceblue.club ( participate in events and experiences related to the space art community)

And at participating partners online and worldwide.

#### What cryptocurrency exchange will list the token?
The Lunarbits Token has applied amd approved to  to list on a leading cryptocurrency platform such as MEXC, LA Bank abd others and expects to be published there by start of Q3, 2025 (note this date is subject to change)
